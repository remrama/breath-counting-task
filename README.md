# breath counting task display

This repo has display code for running the breath counting task online. Task originally proposed by [Levinson et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01202), who also has an old online demo [here](http://webtasks.keck.waisman.wisc.edu/breath/demo/), and [Wong et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12671-017-0880-1) provide probably the best/most description of the task details.

There is some other stuff involved in the task (e.g., surveys), but it's mostly modular so the breath counting task could be pulled out.
