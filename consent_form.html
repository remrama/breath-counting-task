      <strong>Short summary</strong><br>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand behavioral and subjective outcomes of sleep and dream patterns. You might be asked to complete a series of online questionnaires about your sleep and dream habits/experiences and personality traits. You might be asked to complete a series of online cognitive tasks that involve focused attention and keyboard/mouse responses. There is little-to-no risk to your participation in this study, and similarly no direct benefits to you. The main benefit of your participation is to broaden our understanding how how sleep and dreams relate to well-being.
